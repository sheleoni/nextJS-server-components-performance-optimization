Visualising whether refactoring a button containing client logic (i.e. `<button onClick={submitData}>Submit</button>`) into server componet and client component (indicated by the `use client` directive) provides significant performance gains.

# Approach



# Visualising and comparing builds

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
